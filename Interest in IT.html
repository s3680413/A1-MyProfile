<p>Information Technology has been my favourite topic since 13 years of age. I am interested in Database Management, Security, Networking
 and Programming. Because technology has been now changing the way we live, the increase of technology skills or IT experts has also been
 increasing in companies. There are many issues and IT problems that our people back home are facing now, so I decided to study IT so that 
 I can help to solve these problems. So, during my studies, I  am expecting to learn any topics related to Information Technology such as coding, 
 database management, how to store data online, security and so on. With my hope that after completing my Bachelor, I can solve all these issues.
