<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
<p>IT has been one of my favourite career since childhood. At age 16, I decided to choose IT as my first option. Learning 
some of the IT subjects in high school makes me I learned Database and some of the Programming languages like pseudo code and python and I found these 
very interesting. In addition to that, I also interested in Help Desk, System Analyst and Cloud Computing. 
I spend most of my time learning database and writing codes rather than doing my other subjects. 
The main reason why I interested in IT is that because I like spending most of my time on the computer since childhood. 
On top of that, technology had just been introduced to my country in the 2000s. Most of the people are not familiar 
with using these technologies and the government need more people expertise in IT to help improve the technology of our 
island</p>
<p>Choosing my University is not my choice, it is an allocation by the Government.</p><br>

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<p>The job holder will be responsible for troubleshooting or configuring network problems, repairing computer’s hardware (system unit, mouse, CPU, etc). 
Apart from that, they are also responsible for installing software into computers when needed by the company or clients. Back in my island, the government 
workers have lots of problems with computers and networks. For instance, most of the worker’s computers are not working, some complain that the network is 
too slow, and they need to install and run software on their computers, but they find it difficult. So, by reading this job, it makes me really want to take 
this job as it is relevant or needed in my island. In addition, I also like solving problems for any problems but most of all I like helping others in need.</p>

<p>Skills needed for these jobs is collaboration, i.e. you must be able to work in a group. Also have to be critical thinking and know how to solve problems. In 
addition, communication skill also one of the most important skill required for this position. Employers are needed to have a good communication so that they can 
explain clearly and properly the problems to the customers or users, and the using of the computers. And you must have a certificate or degree in Help Desk. Furthermore, 
this job holder must have at least two years of work experience in any company or organisation</p><br>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<p>The project is about a mobile flight app. This app is mainly created to be used by adults. It is about using mobile app phones for booking flights, getting your seat number, 
gate number and so on. This project will allow the users to use it for free. In addition, the app also helps the users (passengers) to search for cheap flights and to get boarding 
pass at their own convenience. Furthermore, the project will helps to connect the users to different hotels in the world. </p>

<p>This project is useful to customers in many ways. First of all, it provides convenience to customers. Many airlines require passengers to be at the airport four hours before boarding 
time to check in their luggage, get their boarding pass and seat number, etc. This app helps customers to take their time to get boarding pass, seat number at their own convenience. And 
especially to customers who always in a rush but do not have any baggage to check in. In addition to that, it disseminates information faster. For example, there will be changes to departure 
time, flight gates and sometimes it quite hard to hear announcement at the airport. So, having this app will help you get notifications and updates about these changes</p>

<p>First of all, one feature of this app is ‘Flight Tracker’. This feature is for tracking flights. This includes, how far you are from your departure place, destination, also display the arrival 
time, nearest destination and so forth. During the flight, this feature allows passengers to track how long they have been travelling, how far is from their destination and the total distance of their 
flight. Apart from that, this feature also allows passengers to track multiple flights. For example, if you are on a different flight with your friend, you can check what time she/he will arrive at the 
airport. Another feature is ‘Flight Video & Songs. During the take-off, passengers will be able to watch movies and listen to songs on this app. This helps passengers not feel boring during their flight. 
In addition to that, ‘App guidance’ is another one. Guidelines and tips are helpfully shown in this app to guide people. This is the most important feature in the app which will help the user to get familiar 
with using the app. It provide information of how to track the flight, using some other features like playing music and movie. This helps in reducing the education of passengers or users of how to use the app.
 Furthermore, Flight Details This will include all details about your flight. Which includes the check-in time, gate number, terminal number, boarding time, flight number, weight of luggage accepted on the plane, 
 seat number and so on. </p><br>
